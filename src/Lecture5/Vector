A Vector in Java is a part of the java.util package and is one of the legacy classes in Java that implements the List interface.
It was introduced in JDK 1.0 before collection framework and is synchronized, makint it thread-safe. Now it is a part of collection framework.

However, due to its synchronization overhead, it's generally recommended to use other modern alternatives like ArrayList in single- threaded scenarios.
Despite this, Vector is still useful in certain situations, particularly in multi-threaded environments where thread safety is a concern.

                                        Key Features of
                                        _______________
Dynamic Array: Like ArrayList, Vector is a dynamic array that grows automatically when more elements are added than its current capacity.

Synchronized: All the methods in Vector are synchronized, which makes it threaded-safe. This means multiple threads can work on a Vector without the risk of corrupting the data.
              However, this can introduce performance overhead in single-threaded environments.

Legacy Class: Vector was part of Java's original release and is considered a legacy class. It's generally recommended to use ArrayList in single-threaded environments due to performance considerations.

Resizing Mechanism: When the current capacity of the vector is exceeded, it doubles its size by default (or increases by a specific capacity increment if provided).

Random Access: Similar to arrays and ArrayList, Vector allows random access to elements, making it efficient for accessing elements using an index.

                                        Constructors of Vector
                                        ______________________
Vector(): Creates a vector with an initial capacity of 10.
Vector(int initialCapacity): Creates a vector with a specified initial capacity.
Vector(int initialCapacity, int capacityIncrement): Creates a vector with an initial capacity and capacity increment
                                                    (how much thee vector should grow when its capacity is exceeded).
Vector(Collection<?extends E>c): Creates a vector containing the elements of the specified collection.

                                        Methods in Vector
                                        _________________
-> add(E e): Adds an element at the end.
-> add(int index, E element): Inserts an element at the specified index.
-> get(int index): Retrieves the element at the specified index.
-> set(int index, E element): Replaces the element at the specified index.
-> remove(Object o): Removes the first occurrence of the specified element.
-> remove(int index): Removes the element at the specifid index.
-> size(): Returns the number of elements in the vector.
-> isEmpty(): Checks if the vector is empty.
-> contains(Object o): Checks if the vector contains the specified element.
-> clear(): Removes all elements from the vector.

                                Internal Implementation of Vector
                                _________________________________
Internally, Vector uses an array to store its elements.
The size of this array grows as needed when more elements are added.
The default behavior is to double the size of the array when it runs out of space.
This operation is a costly one, as it requires copying the old elements to the new, larger array.

                                Synchronization and Performance
                                _______________________________
Since Vector methods are synchronized, it ensures that only one thread can access the vector at a time.
This makes it thread-safe but can introduce performance overhead in single-threaded environments because synchronization adds locking and unlocking costs.

In modern Java applications, ArrayList is generally preferred over Vector when synchnorization isn't required. For thread-safe collection,
the CopyOnWriteArrayList or ConcurrentHashMap from the java.util.concurrent package is often recommended instead.

1. Vector is a legacy synchronized collection class that implements the List interface.
2. It behaves like a dynamic array and grows as needed.
3. It provides thread safety but with a performance cost in single-threaded environments.
4. In modern applications, ArrayList or concurrent alternatives like CopyOnWriteArrayList are typically preferred over Vector unless thread safety is a priority.
