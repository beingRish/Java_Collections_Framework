Since Stack extends Vector, It is synchronized, making it thread-safe.

LIFO Structure: Stack follows the Last-In-First-Out(LIFO) principle, wheree last element added is the first one to be removed.
Inheritance: Stack is a subclass of Vector, which means it inherits all the features of a dynamic array but is constrained by the stack's LIFO nature.
