Key Interfaces in the Collection Framework:

The collection Framework is primarily built around a set of interfaces.
important ones are:

Collection: The root interface for all the other collection types.
List: An ordered collection that can contain duplicate elements(e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).
Set: A collection that cannot contain duplicate elements(e.g., HashSet, TreeSet).
Queue: A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing(e.g., PriorityQueue, LinkedList when used as a queue).
Deque: A double-ended queue that allows insertion and removal from both ends(e.g., ArrayDeque).
Map: An interface that represents a collection of key-value pairs(e.g., HashMap, TreeMap).

Collection Hierarchy: The Collection Framework is organized into a hierarchy where the core interfaces are at the top,
    and the specific implementations extend these interfaces.

Collection Interface:
The Collection interface is the root interface of thee Java Collection Framework.
It is the most basic interface that defines a group of objects known as elements.
The Collection interface is a part of the java.util package, and It is a parent
interface that is extended by other collection interfaces like List, Set, and Queue.

Since Collection is an interface, it cannot be instantiated directly; rather it
provides a blueprint for the basic operations that are common to all collections.

The Collection interface defines a set of core methods that are implemented by all
classes that implement the interface. These methods allow for basic operations
such as adding, removing, and checking thee existench of elements in a collection.
