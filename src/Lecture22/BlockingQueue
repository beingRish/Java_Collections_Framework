threead-safe queue
wait for queue to become non-empty / wait for space
simplify concurrency problems like producer-consumer
standard queue --> immediately
    empty --> remove ( no waiting )
    full --> add ( no waiting )
Blocking queue
    put --> Blocks if the queue is full until space becomes available
    take --> Blocks if the queue is empty until an element becomes available
    offer --> Waits for space to become available, up to the specified timeout
